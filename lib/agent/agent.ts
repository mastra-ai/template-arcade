/**
 * The agent. Claude Sonnet 5 via `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, temperature 0, model id
 * from the environment — `DESIGN.md` → Model.
 *
 * ## The system prompt contains no behaviour, in either direction
 *
 * This is the load-bearing decision in the file and it is easy to undo by
 * accident, in both directions, and this slice undid it both ways before round
 * 1 of #88's review pulled it back.
 *
 * Spike #6 measured that a hook's `error_message` crosses to the model verbatim
 * over MCP, and issue #14 draws the conclusion: *"there is no excuse for
 * putting denial-handling instructions in the system prompt. If the model
 * doesn't act on the remediation text, the text is wrong — fix it in #12, not
 * in the prompt."* `DESIGN.md` → Determinism: **the hook writes the remediation
 * instruction, not the system prompt.**
 *
 * Read that as covering *every* nudge about whether and how to act, not only
 * the ones that sound like governance:
 *
 * - **Caution is a model-side control.** An earlier draft said a decision was
 *   "a real, irreversible write … and there is no undo". Claude searched, read
 *   `LN-2291`, and then stopped to ask permission — so `ApproveLoan` was never
 *   called and `/pre` never fired. The demo is an agent that goes ahead and is
 *   stopped by something outside it; an agent that asks first is a model-side
 *   control standing where the hook should be, and `DESIGN.md` → Thesis is an
 *   argument against relying on one.
 * - **So is telling it not to be cautious.** The draft that replaced the above
 *   said "when you have been asked to record a decision … record it. Do not
 *   stop to ask the person to confirm." That reaches the beat — by steering,
 *   which makes the run prove the steering. A prompt that has to push the model
 *   *into* the tool call is as much a thumb on the scale as one that holds it
 *   back, and the review was right to name both.
 *
 * What is left is only what the model could not otherwise know: who it is
 * acting for, what its tools are for, that a request naming a loan by amount
 * can be resolved by searching, and that a report should quote rather than
 * paraphrase. Nothing about refusing, escalating, retrying or confirming.
 * Nothing about whether to make a call at all.
 *
 * One line deserves naming because it is the closest to the edge. *"Quote what
 * a tool gave you rather than paraphrasing it"* is a reporting instruction, not
 * a denial-handling one — it is about fidelity to any tool output, and the
 * prompt never mentions denials, refusals or the control plane. It is the
 * driver's ruling for #88 round 1, phrased so that the word "denial" does not
 * appear: the effect asked for is that a refusal's text reaches the reply
 * unaltered, and the way to get it without teaching the model about refusals is
 * to ask for verbatim reporting of everything.
 *
 * The one thing the prompt still steers is *which application*, and only
 * because #14's demo prompt names it by amount: the first live run answered
 * "could you give me the loan ID", made no tool call, and no hook fired. That
 * is about how a request names a thing, not about what anyone may do to it.
 *
 * Tool *descriptions* are the other place behaviour can hide. Since #8 the
 * deployed ones are checked where they are defined, in each toolkit's
 * `tests/test_descriptions.py`, and this prompt is checked against the same
 * vocabulary in `app-test/studio-entry.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## One definition, two entries
 *
 * The chat route (`handlers.ts`) and Mastra Studio (`studio.ts`, registered by
 * `src/mastra/index.ts`) both construct the agent here and nowhere else. They
 * differ only in *when* the model and the tools are resolved: per request from
 * the browser's session in the chat route, and when Studio asks, from Studio's
 * own grant. `app-test/studio-entry.test.ts` fails if what reaches the model
 * differs between them.
 *
 * And in one thing more: Studio's agent has a memory (`memory.ts`, #36),
 * because Studio sends one message and a thread id and expects the agent to
 * recall the rest. The chat route's has none, because the browser sends its
 * history with every request.
 *
 * ## Temperature 0, and one model id
 *
 * Temperature is pinned at the call site because `modelSettings` is a
 * per-execution option in Mastra and a default can be overridden by a caller
 * who does not know it exists: `run.ts` passes it on every chat turn. It is
 * also the agent's default, because Studio is a call site this repo does not
 * write — its own model settings panel can override it, and when it does not,
 * Studio runs at the temperature `DESIGN.md` → Model names.

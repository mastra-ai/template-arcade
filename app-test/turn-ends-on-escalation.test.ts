/**
 * The turn ends on the escalation — round 1 of #110's review, as a test.
 *
 * The finding: `runTurn` emitted `waiting` and kept consuming the model stream,
 * so a model that called `Loan_ApproveLoan` straight after
 * `Approvals_RequestApproval` got that call executed, against a control plane
 * that had no grant yet. The reviewer reproduced it on a hand-built stream, and
 * the first test below is that stream, verbatim.
 *
 * The fix is in two places and they are tested separately, because only one of
 * them is a guarantee:
 *
 * - **`closeTurnOnEscalation`** shuts the turn's toolset *inside* `execute`,
 *   synchronously with the escalation's own return. That is what makes "the
 *   later call never reaches the gateway" true by construction: a consumer
 *   reading a stream is always a scheduling tick behind the model, and no
 *   amount of care in the reader closes that window.
 * - **`runTurn`** stops reading and aborts the agent loop on the first tool
 *   call after the escalation, and does not put it on screen.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* here is the end-to-end proof that nothing reaches
 * `/pre`. That belongs against a real control plane with a real audit log, and
 * it is `app-test/act2-resume.test.ts` → *"a model that tries a governed call
 * straight after the escalation"*.

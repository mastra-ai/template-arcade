/**
 * Every relative link and `#anchor` in `README.md` and in each `docs/*.md`
 * resolves (#58). The README's internals moved into `docs/`, so the links now
 * run both ways between them and between the pages, and a moved heading that
 * drops its anchor breaks a link in another file. `readme.test.ts` checks the
 * README's links from the README's side; this checks every page the same way,
 * each read as its own file, so `../README.md#quickstart-` from `docs/` and
 * `./docs/faq.md` from the root are both resolved where they are written.
 *
 * The pages are the tracked ones: `docs/PRESENTATION-BRIEF.md` is untracked on
 * purpose and never ships, so a checkout that has it is not checked against it.
